## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer who enjoys building systems with functional programming and Clojure(Script), building great teams, and growing and maintaining an open source community.

# About me, at a glance

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

  - [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva), as a primary maintainer. I work closely with the creator of Calva, Peter StrÃ¶mberg.
  
  - Learning the [Kappa Architecture](https://milinda.pathirage.org/kappa-architecture.com/), a potentially better way to build information systems. Specifically, learning Kafka and Kafka Streams for building event-driven systems using CQRS and event sourcing.
  
  - Learning multi-platform (Android/iOS/Web) development with React Native and ClojureScript.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning how to build better, more maintainable and flexible software, how to be more efficient at building applications, and how to work with people more effectively, including collaborating with others and growing great teams. I believe great software is built with good communication and people skills.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been funded by [Clojurists Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/) twice, to work on [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva). During those funding periods, I built an [expression-based debugger](https://calva.io/debugger/), and added static analysis features by integrating [clojure-lsp](https://calva.io/clojure-lsp/).

- :book: Resources that have shaped the way I think about building software: [Out of the Tarpit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf), [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month), [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer), [Rich Hickey talks](https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub#talks).
