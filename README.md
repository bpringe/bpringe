## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer who enjoys building systems with functional programming and Clojure(Script), building great teams, and growing and maintaining an open source community.

# About me, at a glance

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

  - [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva), as a primary maintainer. I work closely with the creator of Calva, Peter StrÃ¶mberg.
  
  - Co-leading the tech side of a fintech company in the real-estate space, where we use event-driven architecture with Clojure, Kafka, and Kafka Streams to build reliable, easy-to-maintain systems. We also use ClojureScript for mobile and web app development, along with TypeScript for pure components.
  
- ðŸŒ± I strive to build better, more maintainable and flexible software and work with people effectively. I believe great software is built with good communication and people skills.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been funded by [Clojurists Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/) twice, to work on [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva). During those funding periods, I added an [expression-based debugger](https://calva.io/debugger/) and static analysis features by integrating [clojure-lsp](https://calva.io/clojure-lsp/).

- :book: Resources that have shaped the way I think about building software: [Out of the Tarpit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf), [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month), [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer), [Release It!](https://www.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395), [Rich Hickey talks](https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub#talks).
