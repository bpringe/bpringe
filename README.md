### Hello 👋

I'm a passionate software developer who enjoys building things with functional programming and Clojure(Script).

#### About me, at a glance

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:

  - [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva), as a primary maintainer. I work closely with the creator of Calva, Peter Strömberg.
  
  - SimpleFi, a personal finance application idea of mine, built with Clojure and ClojureScript, using pedestal, re-frame, and postgresql. (Not yet released, and a bit of a hobby and learning project, but may turn it into more.)
  
- 🌱 I’m always learning how to build better, more maintainable and flexible software, how to be more efficient at building applications, and how to work with people more effectively, including collaborating with others and growing great teams. I believe great software is built with good communication and people skills.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I was funded by Clojurists Together to work on [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva), for which, during that time, I built an [expression-based debugger](https://calva.io/debugger/).
