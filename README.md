## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer who enjoys building systems with functional programming and Clojure(Script).

## About me, at a glance

- ðŸ’» My previous two roles:
  - Senior Software Engineer and Head of Engineering at [Crescent](https://www.getcrescent.com/), where we used Datomic and Clojure to build and maintain a robust backend to support our brokerage and business checking account products.
  - Co-founder and Co-VP of Engineering at [HonestDeed](https://honestdeed.com/), where we used an event-driven architecture with Clojure, Kafka, and Kafka Streams to build reliable, easy-to-maintain systems. We also used ClojureScript for mobile and web app development, along with TypeScript for pure components.

- ðŸ”§ Co-maintainer of [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva).
  
- ðŸŒ± I strive to build better, more maintainable and flexible software and work with people effectively. I believe great software is built with good communication and people skills.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been funded by [Clojurists Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/) twice to work on [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva). During those funding periods, I added an [expression-based debugger](https://calva.io/debugger/) and static analysis features by integrating [clojure-lsp](https://calva.io/clojure-lsp/).

- ðŸ“– Some resources that have shaped the way I think about building software: [Out of the Tarpit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf), [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month), [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer), [Release It!](https://www.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395), [Rich Hickey talks](https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub#talks).
